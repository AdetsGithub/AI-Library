# AI-Library

This is a project to make a simple, encapsulated and well commented and documented framework for making neural nets. As far as possible, I adhere to OOP paradigms and intend the library as a soft introduction to neural networks. I hope to also produce a latex file on the intuition behind design choices and produce documentation.

## Getting started

You will need to install some dependencies for the code to run. These are minimal as code is mostly just vanilla python, NumpPy and graphing libraries
```
pip install matlplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install keras
```

## TODO

- Documentation
- Writeup
- Convnet implementation
- RNN implementatio
