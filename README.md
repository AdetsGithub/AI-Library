# AI-Library

![https://udayton.edu/magazine/2021/01/images/2101_neuralnetwork_card.jpg]

This is a project to make a simple, encapsulated and well commented and documented framework for making neural nets. As far as possible, I adhere to OOP paradigms and intend the library as a soft introduction to neural networks. I hope to also produce a latex file on the intuition behind design choices.

## Getting started

You will need to install some dependencies for the code to run. These are minimal as code is mostly just vanilla python, NumpPy and graphing libraries
```
pip install matlplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install keras
```

## Documentation

Documentation is auto-generated using PyDoc. Navigate to AI-Library directory and run
```
python3 -m pydoc -p 3000
```
or
```
python -m pydoc -p 3000
```
depending on operating system.

## TODO

- [x] Documentation 12/07/24
- [ ] Writeup
- [ ] Convnet implementation
- [ ] RNN implementation
